# AntiZapret VPN in Docker

Antizapret created to redirect only blocked domains to VPN tunnel. Its called split tunneling.
This repo is based on idea from original [AntiZapret LXD image](https://bitbucket.org/anticensority/antizapret-vpn-container/src/master/)

# Support and discussions group:
https://t.me/antizapret_support

# How  works?

1) List of blocked domains downloaded from open registry.
2) List parsed and rules for dns resolver (adguardhome) created.
3) Adguardhome resend requests for blocked domains to python script dnsmap.py.
4) Python script:
   a) resolve real address for domain
   b) create fake address from 10.244.0.0/15 subnet
   c) create iptables rule to forward all packets from fake ip to real ip.
5) Fake IP is sent in DNS response to client
6) All vpn tunnels configured with split tunneling. Only traffic to 10.244.0.0/15 subnet is routed through VPN.

# Features

- [openvpn-dco](https://openvpn.net/as-docs/tutorials/tutorial--turn-on-openvpn-dco.html) - a kernel extension for improving performance of OpenVPN
- Multiple VPN transports: Wireguard, OpenVPN, IPsec/XAuth ("Cisco IPsec")
- Adguard as main DNS resolver
- filebrowser as web viewer & editor for `*-custom.txt` files
- Unified dashboard
- Optional built-in reverse proxy based on caddy


# Installation

0. Install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/):
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
   sudo sh get-docker.sh
   ```
1. Clone repository and start container:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xtrime-ru/antizapret-vpn-docker.git antizapret
   cd antizapret
   ```
2. Create docker-compose.override.yml with services you need. Minimal example with only wireguard:
```yml
services:
  antizapret:
    environment:
      - ADGUARDHOME_PASSWORD=somestrongpassword
  wireguard:
     environment:
        - WIREGUARD_PASSWORD=somestrongpassword
     extends:
        file: services/wireguard/docker-compose.yml
        service: wireguard
     depends_on:
        - antizapret
```
Find full example in [docker-compose.override.sample.yml](./docker-compose.override.sample.yml)

3. Start services:
```shell
   docker compose pull
   docker compose build
   docker compose up -d
   docker system prune -f
```

## Access admin panels:

### HTTP: 
By default panels have following http ports exposed to internet:
- dashboard: no exposed port
- adguard: 3000
- filebrowser: 2000
- openvpn: 8080
- wireguard: 51821
- wireguard-amnezia: 51831

If you do not wish to expose ports to internet override them in `docker-compose.override.yml`.
In this example adguard and wireguard admin panels are removed from internet, and wireguard udp server is exposed: 
```yml
services:
   antizapret:
      environment:
         - ADGUARDHOME_USERNAME=admin
         - ADGUARDHOME_PASSWORD=password
      ports: !reset []

   wireguard:
      extends:
         file: services/wireguard/docker-compose.yml
         service: wireguard
      environment:
         - WIREGUARD_PASSWORD=password
      ports: !override
         - 51820:51820/udp
```

### HTTPS
To enable https server and create self-signed certificates - add `proxy` container to `docker-compose.override.yml`
When `proxy` container is started, access services with https at following ports at your host ip:
- dashboard: 443
- adguard: 1443
- filebrowser: 2443
- openvpn: 3443
- wireguard: 4443
- wireguard-amnezia: 5443

`proxy` container is optional.

### Local network
   When you connected to VPN, you can access containers without exposing ports to internet:
- http://core.antizapret:3000
- http://dashboard.antizapret:80
- http://wireguard-amnezia.antizapret:51821
- http://wireguard.antizapret:51821
- http://openvpn-ui.antizapret:8080
- http://filebrowser.antizapret:80

## Update

```shell
git pull
docker compose pull
docker compose build
docker compose down --remove-orphans && docker compose up -d --remove-orphans
```

### Upgrade from v3
**Only WireGuard/Amnezia configs can be moved**, please make backup WireGuard files (from `./.etc_wireguard` or `./.etc_wireguard_amnezia`) and put them in `./config/wireguard` or `./config/wireguard_amnezia` accordingly after steps below.

Recommended to perform full remove of old version:
```shell
docker compose down --remove-orphans
docker system prune -af
cd ../
rm -rf antizapret/
```

Then follow installation steps from this README.

## Reset:
Remove all settings, vpn configs and return initial state of service:
```shell
docker compose down
rm -rf config/*
docker compose up -d
```

# Documentation

## DNS resolving algorithm

When DNS request arrives aguard:
1. Check if with blacklist rules. If domain in blacklist - return 0.0.0.0 and client not able to access domain.
2. Send DNS request to internal dnsmap.py server (127.0.0.4).
3. dnsmap.py sends request back to adguard
4. Adguard recieves requests one more time, but now applies rules with `$client=127.0.0.1` and real upstream server client (8.8.8.8 by default)
5. If domain in whitelist - adguard will resolve its adress and return to dnsmap.py
6. If domain not in whitelist adguard return SERVFAIL
7. dnsmap.py send response to adguard:
   a. If it is valid IP, then replaces it with "internal" IP from `10.224.0.0/15` subnet, add masquerade to iptables and return internal ip to adguard
   b. If is is SERVFAIL it sends this response to client.
8. Adguard get response from dnsmap.py, cache it and forward it to the client.


## Adding Domains
Add domains in adguard panel: http://core.antizapret:3000/#custom_rules
Rules/syntaxes: https://adguard-dns.io/kb/general/dns-filtering-syntax/#basic-examples

By default, adguard rewrite all requests with SERVFAIL. This is only way to make client retry DNS request to second, local DNS server.
Rules with the dnsrewrite response modifier have higher priority than other rules in AdGuard Home and AdGuard DNS.
To override default rule custom rules must have  `$dnsrewrite=` modifier or must be in whitelist section.

To support default adguard filters default SERVFAIL rule applied only to internal requests from client=127.0.0.1.



Examples:
```
@@||subdomain.host.com^$dnsrewrite,client=127.0.0.1
@@||*.host.com^$dnsrewrite,client=127.0.0.1
@@||host.com^$dnsrewrite,client=127.0.0.1
@@||de^$dnsrewrite,client=127.0.0.1

@@/some_.*_regex/$dnsrewrite,client=127.0.0.1
```

Also you can add any urls to whitelist. http://core.antizapret:3000/#dns_allowlists
Whitelist have hiest priority, so no modifiers needed. 
Supported formats: simple list of domaind, adguard format, hosts format.

## Adding IPs/Subnets
Add ips and subnets to `./config/antizapret/custom/include-ips-custom.txt` and run `docker compose exec antizapret doall`


## Environment Variables

You can define these variables in docker-compose.override.yml file for your needs:

Antizapret:
- `SKIP_UPDATE_FROM_ZAPRET=true` - do not download and use list of all blocked domains from internet.
    Will reduce RAM consumption. Need to manually fill domains in `*-custom.txt` files.
- `UPDATE_TIMER=1d` - blocked domains update interval
- `ADGUARDHOME_PORT=3000`
- `ADGUARDHOME_USERNAME=admin`
- `ADGUARDHOME_PASSWORD=`
- `ADGUARDHOME_PASSWORD_HASH=` - hashed password, taken from the AdGuardHome.yaml file after the first run using `ADGUARDHOME_PASSWORD`. Dollar sign `$` in hash must be escaped with another dollar sign: `$$` 
- `DNS=127.0.0.1` - Upstream DNS for resolving blocked sites (adguard by default)
- `ROUTES` - list of VPN containers and their virtual addresses. Needed for uniq client addresses in adguard logs 
- `LISTS` - list of urls to get blocked domains lists
- `IP_LIST` - main url to get list of blocked ips and domains. Override with blank value to disable download of this list.

Filebrowser:
- `FILEBROWSER_PORT=admin`
- `FILEBROWSER_PASSWORD=password`

Proxy:
- `PROXY_DOMAIN=` - create lets-encrypt https certificate for domain. If not set host ip is used for self-signed certificate.
- `PROXY_EMAIL=` - email for letsecnrypt certificate.

Openvpn
- `OBFUSCATE_TYPE=0` - custom obfuscation level of openvpn protocol.
   0 - disable.Act as regular openvpn client, support by all clients.
   1 - light obfuscation, works with microtics
   2 - strong obfuscation, works with some clients: openvpn gui client, asuswrt client...
- `ANTIZAPRET_SUBNET=10.224.0.0/15` - subnet for virtual blocked ips

Openvpn-ui
- `OPENVPN_ADMIN_PASSWORD=` — will be used as a server address in .ovpn profiles upon keys generation (default: your server's IP)
- `OPENVPN_DNS_AZ=10.1.165.1` - first, private DNS address blocked sites (adguard). Must be in `ANTIZAPRET_SUBNET`
- `OPENVPN_DNS_LOCAL=8.8.8.8` - second, public DNS address for NON blocked sites. Client will send requests directly, without VPN
- `OPENVPN_LOCAL_IP_RANGE=10.1.165.0` - subnet for ovpn clients. Subnet can be viewed in adguard journal or in ovpn-ui panel

Wireguard/Wireguard Amnezia
- `WIREGUARD_PASSWORD=` - password for admin panel
- `WIREGUARD_PASSWORD_HASH=` - [hashed password](https://github.com/wg-easy/wg-easy/blob/v14.0.0/How_to_generate_an_bcrypt_hash.md) for admin panel
- `ANTIZAPRET_SUBNET=10.224.0.0/15` - subnet for virtual blocked ips
- `WG_DEFAULT_DNS=10.224.0.1` - DNS address for clients. Must be in `ANTIZAPRET_SUBNET`
- `WG_PERSISTENT_KEEPALIVE=25`
- `PORT=51821` - admin panel port
- `WG_PORT=51820` - wireguard server port
- `WG_DEVICE=eth0`

Wireguard, Wireguard Amnezia, Openvpn:
- `FORCE_FORWARD_DNS=true` - Redirects UDP traffic on port 53 to AntiZapret DNS (default: false)
- `FORCE_FORWARD_DNS_PORTS="53 5353"` - Parameter can be used to change port 53 for FORCE_FORWARD_DNS to one or more, separated by a space (default: 53)
- For other environment variables, see the original manual [Wireguard Amnezia](https://github.com/w0rng/amnezia-wg-easy) or [Wireguard](https://github.com/wg-easy/wg-easy).

## DNS
### Adguard Upstream DNS
Adguard uses Google DNS and Quad9 DNS to resolve unblocked domains. This upstreams support ECS requests (more info below).
Cloudflare DNS do not support ECS and is not recommended for use.  

Source code: [Adguard upstream DNS](./antizapret/root/adguardhome/upstream_dns_file_basis)
After container is started working copy is located here: `./config/adguard/conf/upstream_dns_file_basis`

### CDN + ECS
Some domains can resolve differently, depending on subnet (geoip) of client. In this case using of DNS located on remote server will break some services.
ECS allow to provide client IP in DNS requests to upstream server and get correct results.
Its enabled by default in Adguard and client ip is pointed to Moscow (Yandex Subnet).

If you located in other region, you need to replace `77.88.8.8` with your real ip address on this page `http://your-server-ip:3000/#dns`



## OpenVpn
### Create client certificates:
https://github.com/d3vilh/openvpn-ui?tab=readme-ov-file#generating-ovpn-client-profiles
1) go to `http://%your_ip%:8080/certificates`
2) click "create certificate"
3) enter unique name. Leave all other fields empty
4) click create
5) click on certificate name in list to download ovpn file.

### Enable OpenVPN Data Channel Offload (DCO)
[OpenVPN Data Channel Offload (DCO)](https://openvpn.net/as-docs/openvpn-dco.html) provides performance improvements by moving the data channel handling to the kernel space, where it can be handled more efficiently and with multi-threading.
**tl;dr** it increases speed and reduces CPU usage on a server.

Kernel extensions can be installed only on <u>a host machine</u>, not in a container.

#### Ubuntu 24.04
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
echo "#### Please reboot your system after upgrade ###" && sleep 100
sudo apt install -y efivar
sudo apt install -y openvpn-dco-dkms
```

#### Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
echo "#### Please reboot your system after upgrade ###" && sleep 100
deb=openvpn-dco-dkms_0.0+git20231103-1_all.deb
sudo apt install -y efivar dkms linux-headers-$(uname -r)
wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/o/openvpn-dco-dkms/$deb
sudo dpkg -i $deb
```

### Legacy clients support
If your clients do not have GCM ciphers support you can use legacy CBC ciphers.
DCO is incompatible with legacy ciphers and will be disabled. This is also increase CPU load.


## Amnezia Wireguard

### Enable Amnezia Wireguard Kernel Extension

https://github.com/amnezia-vpn/amneziawg-linux-kernel-module?tab=readme-ov-file#ubuntu

1. Edit  `vi /etc/apt/sources.list` and uncomment `deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu ... main restricted`
2. `sudo apt update`
3. `sudo apt install -y software-properties-common python3-launchpadlib gnupg2 linux-headers-$(uname -r)`
4. install source for kernel `sudo apt-get source linux-image-$(uname -r)`
5. `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:amnezia/ppa`
6. `sudo apt-get install -y amneziawg`
7. `sudo dkms install -m amneziawg -v 1.0.0`
8. restart server or `docker compose restart wireguard-amnezia`
9. check the list of kernel modules `dkms status`, 
   and check that bunch of `[kworker/X:X-wg-crypt-wg0]` processes are now running.

### Amnezia Wireguard Block
Some providers can block AWG with default junk packets size. Large junk packets without response can be judged as DDOS attack.
Use env variables to change their size:

```
Jc=3
Jmin=20
Jmax=100
```
or
```
Jc=2
Jmin=10
Jmax=20
```
Example part of docker-compose.override.yml with JMIN and JMAX:
```yml
  wireguard-amnezia:
    environment:
      - WIREGUARD_PASSWORD=xxxxx
      - JC=3
      - JMIN=20
      - JMAX=100
    extends:
      file: services/wireguard/docker-compose.yml
      service: wireguard-amnezia
```
Settings/env variables are saved in ./config/wireguard_amnezia/ folder. To update them remove folder and run container again.
This will also remove all existing clients/certificates.
```shell
docker compose down && rm -rf ./config/wireguard_amnezia/ && docker compose up -d
```

### VPN / Hosting block
Most providers now block vpn to foreign IPs. Obfuscation in amnezia or openvpn not always fix the issue.
For stable vpn operation you can buy VPS inside of your country and then proxy all traffic to foreign server.
Here is example of startup script.
Replace X.X.X.X with IP address of your server and run it on fresh VPS (ubuntu 24.04 is recommended):

```shell
#!/bin/sh

# Fill with your foreign server ip
export VPN_IP=X.X.X.X

echo "net.ipv4.ip_forward=1" >> /etc/sysctl.d/99-sysctl.conf
sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

# DNAT rules
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp ! --dport 22 -j DNAT --to-destination "$VPN_IP"
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p udp ! --dport 22 -j DNAT --to-destination "$VPN_IP"
# MASQUERADE rules
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -p tcp -d "$VPN_IP" -j MASQUERADE
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -p udp -d "$VPN_IP"  -j MASQUERADE

echo iptables-persistent iptables-persistent/autosave_v4 boolean true | sudo debconf-set-selections
echo iptables-persistent iptables-persistent/autosave_v6 boolean false | sudo debconf-set-selections
apt install -y iptables-persistent

```

## Test speed with iperf3
iperf3 server is included in antizapret-vpn container.
1. Connect to VPN
2. Use iperf3 client on your phone or computer to check upload/download speed.
    Example 10 threads for 10 seconds and report result every second:
    ```shell
    iperf3 -c 10.224.0.1 -i1 -t10 -P10
    iperf3 -c 10.224.0.1 -i1 -t10 -P10 -R
    ```

## IPsec/XAuth (Cisco IPsec) server
**Important notice**: not all clients support tunnel-split (send only part of traffic via VPN).
For example **Apple** devices **will not** be able **to connect** to this server.

**Recommended to use OpenVPN or Wireguard/Amnezia instead.**

1. Create settings file:
   ```shell
   cp ipsec/ipsec.env.example ipsec/ipsec.env
   ```
2. Fill your creditentials in `ipsec/ipsec.env`
3. Start
   ```shell
   docker compose down
   docker compose -f docker-compose.ipsec.yml up -d
   ```
4. Setup your clients: https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn/blob/master/docs/clients-xauth.md
